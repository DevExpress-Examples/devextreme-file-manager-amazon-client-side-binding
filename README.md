# DevExtreme FileManager - Amazon S3 Client-Side Binding

This example uses a custom file provider to connect the FileManager component to the Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) on the client. The [Custom File System Provider](https://js.devexpress.com/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxFileManager/File_System_Providers/Custom) allows you to implement custom APIs to handle file operations (add, delete, rename, etc.). All APIs used to access Amazon S3 services on the client are stored in the `amazon.file.system.js` file (`app.service.ts` - for Angular framework). If you expect to use Amazon Simple Storage Service, you should create a bucket, create a user, and add permissions to access the created bucket.

**IMPORTANT**

The code snippets in this repository are for informational purposes only. Security should be your #1 priority when using Amazon S3 storage. You should consult a security expert or apply accepted best practices to maintain the highest security posture for your DevExtreme-powered web application. Remember, a secure web app demands careful consideration/understanding of potential attack vectors, the configuration of your development environment, and security posture of third-party service providers.

If running our Angular, React, Vue, or jQuery example, you need to also run our .NET-based backend project - **Amazon_Backend**. To connect this project to an Amazon S3 server, you need to specify Amazon credentials of the user created previously. You will also need to update the AWS section in [appsettings.json](Amazon_Backend/appsettings.json):

```json
"AWS": {
    "AccessKey": "yourAccessKey",
    "SecretKey": "yourSecretKey",
    "Region": "region",
    "Bucket": "your bucket name"
  },
```
